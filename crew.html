                <p>
                  The seeds of the Chronicles of the Milky Way Galaxy were first sown twenty-six years ago, when the author was just fifteen. What began as a spark of adolescent imagination transformed into a lifelong pursuit of cosmic world-building. For the first two decades, the work was a silent, internal labor—a meticulous process of constructing a universe from the Big Bang (Year 0 eo) to the height of the Thiran Empire, ensuring that every law of physics, every alien biology, and every political tithe was mathematically and logically sound.

After twenty years of refining the timeline and the lore, the project has transitioned from the mind to the page. We are now in the era of manifestation.

The result is a sprawling six-book epic and a collection of novellas that challenge the boundaries of sci-fi and fantasy. The author’s writing is defined by its massive scale, "show, don't tell" cinematic prose, and a gritty exploration of sovereignty versus stability. Having spent more than half a lifetime living within this galaxy, the author doesn't just write these stories—he documents a living history that has been twenty-six years in the making.
