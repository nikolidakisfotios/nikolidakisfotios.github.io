                        <p><b>The Architect of Empire.</b> Alex is the central figure around whom the fate of the Milky Way rotates. Beginning as a survivor in the desperate final days of Earth, his trajectory from a human leader to the immortal Grand Emperor is the backbone of the saga.</p>
                        <p>A visionary of cold, pragmatic genius, Alex realized early on that for life to survive the chaos of the cosmos, it required a "Blanket" of absolute order.</p>
                        <p>He is the architect of the Three Fundamental Laws and the founder of Thira. While often viewed as a cold autocrat, Alex’s motivations are rooted in a deep-seated obsession with evolution and the preservation of sentient life against external threats—be they rogue planets or ancient, hidden masters.</p>

                        <p><b>The Anchor of Humanity.</b> Jain stands as the essential counterbalance to Alex’s grand ambitions. From the earliest days of Project Gaia, she was the one who could see the man behind the Emperor.</p>
                        <p>Where Alex looks at the galaxy in terms of logistics, tithes, and evolution, Jain remains connected to the individual cost of those decisions.</p>
                        <p>As one of the few humans to bridge the gap between the death of Earth and the height of the Empire, she serves as a repository of human history and emotion. In the Imperial Era, her presence is a stabilizing force within Alex’s inner circle, often acting as the silent conscience of the throne.</p>
